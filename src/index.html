      <h1>More Information</h1>
      <p>&emsp;The goal of this map to to display the relationships between key data sets relattng to the Covid pandemic
        in the U.S.. It was made initially to for fill the requirement of a final project for the ANTH323: Plagues,
        Pathogens and Public Policy course at UMD.</p>

      <p>&emsp;This map, while providing insights, has its limits. The purpose of the map is showing changes over time
        of
        key indicators of the Covid-19 pandemic in the U.S.. It can be used as a base board to inform deeper questions
        and
        conversations around the data it represents. To provoke some deeper questions, first keep in mind that the U.S.
        response to the Covid-19 pandemic came with lots of political decisions and turbulence. It has to be understood
        that the structural state of the U.S.’s health care system had a great effect on its ability to respond to the
        pandemic [1]. Furthermore economic inequality played a large role in who got help and how much, which is why
        average income is a data point in the map [1]. Also since the map shows key pieces of information by location
        keep
        in mind that people's health is heavily induced by environmental factors. The location people live and work have
        factors such as air pollution, water quality, access to food, and local pollution levels which all affect
        people's
        health [2]. All of these environmental factors affect people's health and their ability to deal with infectious
        diseases. Furthermore where people live and what access they get often correlates to their socioeconomic-status.
        We should ask who chose to allow this negative environmental factor to exist and is that the same person that
        will
        be affected by it? On top of that in the U.S. people of color have experienced the brunt of negative
        environmental
        factors via for example redlining [3]. Because of that this map can also represent an environmental justice
        issue
        in the question of who gets what access to health resources and why [4]. Hopefully keeping those points in mind
        it
        feels like the data displayed here has more weight and can be used to spark further research.</p>
